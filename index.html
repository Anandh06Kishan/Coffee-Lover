       <p>
         <ol>
           <li>Coffee may help protect against type 2 diabetes. Researchers at UCLA identified that drinking coffee increases plasma levels of the protein sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).</li>
           <li>Researchers in the U.S. carried out a study that assessed the link between coffee consumption and Parkinson's disease risk. </li>
           <li>Italian researchers found that coffee consumption lowers the risk of liver cancer by about 40%</li>
           <li>Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Harvard School of Public Health, concluded that drinking coffee in moderation protects against heart failure.</li>
            </li>

         </ol>
       </p>
           <h3>Other possible benefits</h3>
           <p>Studies have suggested that coffee may:</p>
             <ol>
               <li>help prevent premature death</li>
               <li>reduce mortality</li>
               <li>protect against cirrhosis</li>
               <li>reduce the risk ofmultiple sclerosis</li>
               <li>protect against colorectal cancer</li>

             </ol>
           </p>

       <h3>NOTE:The researchers say coffee drinkers should stick to "healthy coffees" - which avoid extra sugar, milk or cream, or a fatty snack on the side. </h3>

   <p>A study done by the National Institute of Health found that those who drink four or more cups of coffee were about 10 percent less likely to be depressed than those who had never touched the java. And apparently it's not because of the "caffeine high" -- Coke can also give you a caffeine high, but it's linked to depression. Study author, Honglei Chen, MD, PhD, told Prevention.com that the proposed reason coffee makes you feel good is because of those trusty antioxidants.</p>
   <br>
   <p>A study done by the Harvard School of Public Health determined that drinking between two and four cups of coffee can reduce the risk of suicide in men and women by about 50 percent. The proposed reason is because coffee acts as a mild antidepressant by aiding in the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline.</p>
