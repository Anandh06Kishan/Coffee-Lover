        <h1>Types of coffee</h1>

        <h3 class='typeC'>Caffè Americano</h3>

        <p>You can make this type of coffee quite simply by adding hot water to a shot of espresso coffee. It has been said that American soldiers during the Second World War would make this type of coffee to make their beverages last longer. It was then (apparently) adopted by American baristas after the war.</p>

        <h3 class='typeC'>Café Latte (or Café au lait)</h3>

        <p>A fairly popular option for coffee drinkers, a latte consists steamed (or scolded) milk and a single shot of coffee. It is usually quite frothy, and you’ll occasionally encounter cafes that don’t understand the difference between this and a flat white.</p>

        <h3 class='typeC'>Cappuccino</h3>

        <p>Possibly the most popular type of coffee in the world, a cappuccino consists of three layers (kind of like a cake). The first is a shot of espresso, then a shot of steamed milk, and finally the barista adds a layer of frothed, foamy milk. This final layer can also be topped with chocolate shavings or powder. Traditionally, Italians would consume this type of coffee at breakfast.</p>

        <h3 class='typeC'>Espresso</h3>
        <img class="image" src="http://makegoodcoffee.com/coffee-talk/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/espresso.jpg" alt="">
        <p>To make an espresso, shoot boiling water under high pressure through finely ground up coffee beans and then pour into a tiny mug. Sounds simple right? Well, it’s surprisingly difficult to master. Espressos are the purest coffee experience you can get, and while they’re not for everyone, it can be a truly singular drinking experience when you find a good brew.</p>

        <h3 class='typeC'>Flat White</h3>
        <img class="image" src="https://www.costacoffee.ae/media/10624/flat-white.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The most Aussie coffees available are the long black and the flat white – as both originated in Australia and New Zealand. For a flat white, the steamed milk from the bottom of the jug (which is usually not so frothy, but rather creamy) is poured over a shot of espresso. It is now popular among mums and dads at school fetes who are desperately trying to stay awake.</p>


                <h3 class='typeC'>Long Black</h3>
                <img class="image" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OK1MiSZS5Wo/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Hot water is poured into a cup, and then two shots of espresso are poured into the water. If you do the inverse of this, it will result in an Americano. Long blacks can be quite strong, and have more crema (a creamy foam that tops espresso shots) than an Americano.</p>
